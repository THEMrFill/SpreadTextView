# This is a simple class to spread lines of text evenly over the size of the TextView.
# Rather than having one LONG line and a short line, it will distribute the text.
#
# It's very simplistic at the moment, but it "does the job" at the moment, and will
# have some updates to calculate if it looks better with words spread in different
# ways.
